# Construction-services-sample-website
Sample of a construction services company webpage built as a Single Page Application (SPA) format.
The site features a professional, lively interface where users can hover over service blocks to reveal more details.

# Key Features
> Dynamic Service Display: Services such as surveying, site prep, major construction, roofing, plumbing, and electrical installation are presented in an interactive layout.
> Hover Pop-up Details: Hovering over a service block triggers a pop-up with detailed descriptions.
> Asynchronous API Handling: Data is fetched from a local JSON server (db.json) using JavaScript.
> Event Listeners for Interactivity: Multiple event listeners enhance user experience (hover effects, click events, etc.).
> Fully Responsive Design: Optimized for different screen sizes.

# Tech Stack
> Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
> Backend (Mock API): JSON Server (db.json)
> Version Control & Hosting: GitHub

How It Works
> The homepage loads services dynamically from the API (db.json).
> Hovering over a service block reveals additional details in a pop-up.
> JavaScript handles API calls asynchronously using fetch().
> No page reloadsâ€”everything runs as a SPA.
